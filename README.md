[![Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@heroku/update-node-build-script.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@heroku/update-node-build-script)

## Summary

You will need to make sure you are in your application's root directory, then run:

```
$ npx @heroku/update-node-build-script
```

## Why?

To make getting started with Node.js on Heroku easier we will begin executing the `build` script
by default if it is defined in your `package.json`. This change will go live on **Monday, March 11, 2019**.
Read more about this change in [our FAQ](https://help.heroku.com/P5IMU3MP/heroku-node-js-build-script-change-faq).

For users with an existing `build` script that they may not want run during the build, this will
require some slight modifications to their `package.json`. The modifications are simple and mechanical,
and this CLI tool will make updating as easy as possible.

## Usage

You will need to make sure you are in your application's root directory, then run:

```
$ npx @heroku/update-node-build-script
```

`npx` is a tool that comes with the modern verions of `npm` bundled with Node. If for some reason, `npx`
is not available on your system, you can install it with the following command:

```
$ npm install -g npx
```

or download and run this package directly:

```
$ cd $APP_DIRECTORY
$ npm install -g @heroku/update-node-build-script
$ update-node-build-script
```

and then you can uninstall it when you are finished:

```
$ npm uninstall -g @heroku/update-node-build-script
```

## What does this command do?

When it runs it will inspect the contents of your `package.json` file, note which `scripts` you have defined,
and suggest a modification that will opt you in to the new build rules while maintaining your existing build behavior.

It will make no changes without your explicit approval.

## I don't want to run an npx command on my system

No problem! This tool is provided only as a convenience. The changes are documented in [this FAQ](https://help.heroku.com/P5IMU3MP/heroku-node-js-build-script-change-faq)
and are simple to perform manually.
